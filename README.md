# How to Explore APIs üéØ
The idea of this repository is to assist in studies and ways of exploring the API environment.

Before we start with the API exploration phase, it is necessary to have a knowledge base, so I followed in my line of thought, some steps that we should follow to strengthen this base.

## Level One {Start} :books:
The idea here is to spend as much time as you can sharpening the axe, so that the blow is accurate.
It's no use having the best tools in our favor, if we don't have a base, it's necessary to understand how HTTP methods work, error messages, what types of APIs are and how each one of them works.

## Level Two {Recon} ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The first phase of a pentesting is the famous Recon "Information Collection" here is the moment where we must understand about the API infrastructure that we are analyzing.

Here I will provide a "Recon Mindmap" that will help you with some tools and methodologies in the API Recon phase, this mindmap was not created by me.

>https://dsopas.github.io/MindAPI/play/

During my study journey, I made a survey of the most found and exploited vulnerabilities when we talk about APIs:

- API Exposure
- Misconfigured Caching
- Exposed Tokens
- JWT Weaknesses
- Authorization Issues
- Undocumented Endpoints
- Different Versions
- Rate Limiting (BF Allowed)
- Race Conditions
- XXE Injection
- Switching Content Type
- HTTP Methods
- Injection Vulnerabilities
