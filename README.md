# How to Explore APIs
The idea of this repository is to assist in studies and ways of exploring the API environment.

Before we start with the API exploration phase, it is necessary to have a knowledge base, so I followed in my line of thought, some steps that we should follow to strengthen this base.

## Level One {Start}
The idea here is to spend as much time as you can sharpening the axe, so that the blow is accurate.
It's no use having the best tools in our favor, if we don't have a base, it's necessary to understand how HTTP methods work, error messages, what types of APIs are and how each one of them works.
